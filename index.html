              Dragon Ball, is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira
              Toriyama in 1984. The initial manga, written and illustrated by
              Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995,
              with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 tankōbon
              volumes by its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball was initially
              inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West, as
              well as Hong Kong martial arts films. The series follows the
              adventures of the protagonist, Son Goku, from his childhood
              through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the
              world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which
              summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey,
              Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains,
              many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.
